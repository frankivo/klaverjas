###Running the app

Check Franks amazing Dockerfile! I didn't build that, so I don't have a clue how it works :)

Or deploy war-file in container (Tomcat will do)

Or run KlaverjasWebsocketApplication from your IDE.

###User userdetails
Currently hardcoded in the PlayerRepository. Might be moved to some database-y solution.
